12) Click add Peer button. Name: Captain America PC (for example), Click button Generate new key pair, Click Generate preshared key
13) IP adresess: 10.0.0.2/32 (For every another user incremate last number of IP adress. Wolwerine will be: 10.0.0.3/32, Ironman: 10.0.0.4/32, Hulk: 10.0.0.5/32 and so on...)

Connection Endpoint: 85.207.119.6 (= your public IP adress), DNS servers: 8.8.8.8 (default is your OpenWRT adress, probably you doesn't have DNS server there, so use google DNS server instead)
20) Scan QR code to your Android wireguard App. Or for PC copy generated configuration and save it to your PC with Notepad and name it like captain-america-pc.conf After that load this config file with your Wireguard App on PC.

# Apply settings of interface [see wireguard-guide-8.png]
21) Navigate to Network - Interfaces and click on Restart button of your wg0 interface. Only this make your settings applied. Save and Apply button isn't enough. Do this every time when you change settings in your intergace.
